# Normalized-Cuts-and-Image-Segmentation-Implementation
Image segmentation using the Normalized Cuts algorithm (Shi &amp; Malik, 2000). Builds an affinity graph from pixel features, solves a generalized eigenvalue problem to partition the image, and recursively segments until a threshold is reached.
